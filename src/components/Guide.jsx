          <h3>Firm 🏦</h3>
          <p>
            To make the portfolio structure simple, there are three firms
            (Schwab, Fidelity, & Vanguard) where you may have an account, or
            would typically choose from those family of funds. These three offer
            the lowest fees
          </p>
          <h3>Account 🔒</h3>
          <p>
            Investment account type (401k, IRA, Brokerage) to show yearly

          <h3>Risk tolerance ⚠️</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Conservative</strong> being the least risky, or safest, option. This will
            result in lower potential returns</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Aggressive</strong> being the most risky,
            which has potential for the highest returns</p>

            read the description to set what your risk profile is as an

          <h2>Generated Portfolio</h2>
          <h3>Investment Funds 💼</h3>
          <p>
            Your portfolio will consist of large, small, and international
            companies, and depending on risk profile, bonds and cash.
          </p>
          <p>
            Investing in large, small, and international stock will be the
            primary drivers for growth, while bonds and cash are typically used
            for hedging against stock market drops, or for safety.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each fund has a ticker in parentheses, along with how much you'd
            allocate your initial and monthly deposits towards. <strong>The ticker is what you would search when buying shares.</strong>
          </p>
          <h3>Average Return 📈</h3>
          <p>
            Historic average return based on the firm (Schwab, Fidelity, &
            Vanguard) and risk profile
          </p>
          <h3>Estimated Value 💸</h3>
          <p>
            The final value of your portfolio at retirement, based on historical
            returns and your risk profile.
          </p>
          <p>
            This number takes into account fund fees and yearly inflation of 3%.
          </p>
          <p>
            At retirement age, your portfolio will be larger, but the estimated
            value shows your purchasing power in today's dollars
          </p>
